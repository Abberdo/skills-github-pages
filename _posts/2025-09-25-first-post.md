Hello, World! I'm so excited to be writing my very first blog post. I've just started my journey into web development, and this website is my first project. It's a place for me to share what I'm learning, document my progress, and connect with other people who are also just starting out.

What This Website is For?
I created this site using GitHub Pages, which is a fantastic tool for hosting a simple website directly from a GitHub repository. My goal is to use this space as a digital notebook and a portfolio of my work. You'll likely see a lot of posts about basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I build my skills.

A Small Step, A Big Feeling ...
Creating this page was a small step, but it feels like a big achievement. It shows that I'm able to apply the things I'm learning in a real way. If you're also learning to code, remember to celebrate these small wins! They all add up.

Thanks for stopping by. More posts to come soon!
