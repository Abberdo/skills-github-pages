Hi there! My name is Abby, and I'm a beginner programmer excited to be learning about creating websites with GitHub Pages. This page is a simple space for me to practice my skills and share a little bit about myself. I believe in the power of starting small and learning one step at a time. Every line of code I write helps me get a little closer to my goals.

What I'm Learning: 
I'm currently focused on mastering the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build simple, functional web pages. I'm also exploring different ways to use GitHub to share my projects with others. Feel free to reach out and connect!
